* Description: Measurements of electric power consumption in one
  household with a one-minute sampling rate over a period of almost 4 years.
  Different electrical quantities and some sub-metering values are available.

This assignment uses data from
the <a href="http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/">UC Irvine Machine
Learning Repository</a>, a popular repository for machine learning
datasets. In particular, we will be using the "Individual household
electric power consumption Data Set".

## Reviews checklist

You find four R scripts and four PNG files of width 480 * 480 pixel.

It is required to this scripts read the data. As this is the same for
all of the four scripts I source a script called `common.R` to do this.

The Plots below are the results produced by my script.

### R scripts

* [plot1.R]
* [plot2.R]
* [plot3.R]
* [plot4.R]
* [common.R]
